# rock-paper-scissors
Javascript project assignment for The Odin Project.

The objective is to create a console-based program that plays Rock-Paper-Scissors with the user.
Later, there will be an interface on the browser so that it is easier to play.

I intend to use this project as a way to practice some Javascript fundamentals like let and const variables, ternary operators, switch statements and arrow functions.
